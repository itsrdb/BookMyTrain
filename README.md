# BookMyTrain

BookMyTrain provies a train booking API service. Written in Java Spring Boot leveraging Spring Security. 

## Overview

* This API uses protected endpoints which can only be accessed by the Admin or authenticated Users.
* Token based authentication is used for Role based privilages and maintaining session info.
* Semaphores are used to maintain atomicity in transactions, thus allowing multiple uses to book at the same time without breaking.
* Database used is PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

1. By default server port is set to 3000 (Can be changed in Spring application.properties)
2. Create a role and database in PostgreSQL
3. I'm using database named '__train_db__' and postgreSQL port being set to 6432. The database name and port should be replaced in case you have set it differently.
(Can be changed in Spring application.properties)
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:6432/train_db
```
4. Set you username and password configured for postgreSQL in application.properties:
```
spring.datasource.username=rohitborkar
spring.datasource.password=password
```
5. JWT secret key can be replaces with a valid HMAC-SHA256 key, can be replaced in application.properties. (Not necessary)
```
security.jwt.secret-key=
```
